How is the struct of a django project:

When you start a new django project, you are starting the core, then, you need to create apps.Apps are each part in your webapp, for example, the main section or a different section on you webapp.
Each app needs to be connected with the core.

Within your app there are different files:

views.py : One of the most used is views.py, where you can to create your views (messages to show in the browser) and html code.
migratios: The folder 'migratios' is to interact with the DB, django implements python fuctions to interact with the db, it means that is not necessary to make SQl consults directly.
models.py: In this file you can to create the sql schema of the current app.
______________________________________________________________________________

Example to create a new schema:

from django.db import models

# Create your models here.

Each class will be a table in the sql model.
class Project(models.Model):
    # Create the fields
    name = models.CharField(max_length = 45)# VARCHAR(45)

class Task(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length = 45)   
    description = models.TextField()
    project = models.ForeignKey(Project, on_delete = models.CASCADE) #On_delete is for delete all ocurrences if any project is deleted

Example of how to fill the database from the shell:

from MainPage.models import Project, Task

To create a new project:
>>> new_project = Project(name = "First Project")
>>> new_project.save()
>>> new_project.save()
>>> project_2 = Project(name = "Second Project")
>>> project_2.save()

To create a new task from it's project:
>>> new_project.task_set.create(title = "Firs_Task", description = "This task is of the first_project")
<Task: Task object (1)>

________________________________________________________________________________

Basics requests to the DB from the shell:

>>> Project.objects.all()
<QuerySet [<Project: Project object (1)>, <Project: Project object (2)>]>
>>> Project.objects.get(id=2).name
'Second Project'

>>> new_project.task_set.get(title = 'Firs_Task').description
'This task is of the first_project'

>>> Project.objects.filter(name__startswith = 'First')
<QuerySet [<Project: Project object (1)>]>
